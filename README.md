<h2>VIRTUAL MOUSE AND KEYBOARD</h2>

<h3>Aim: </h3>

To be able to control computer mouse & keyboard and perform operations like moving cursor, left-click, right-click, page up/down etc. using hand movement and gestures.


<h3>Requirements: </h3>

Colour Markers, Webcam, MATLAB, Windows PC, Image acquisition toolbox for MATLAB.


<h3>Explanation:</h3>

<h5>The basic flow of the project would be:</h5>

Performing hand gesture(Colour Markers) -> Webcam -> Image Acquisition -> Image Processing -> MATLAB -> Controlling hardware(Personal Computer)


The user would have specified colour markers on his/her fingers and there will be a specific area where the webcam will focus on. That area will have designated sections for various operations and will be the area for cursor movement. The video will be converted into images and weâ€™ll process them using MATLAB. In this will basically extract different colours from the Image. The hardware will be controlled using the Java class java.awt.Robot in MATLAB. Specific colour patterns would mean specific operations. For instance movement of red colour in the area would lead to movement of the cursor. The red marker would be placed on users middle finger and thus the user will be able to easily control the mouse without using the computers touchpad. Detecting blue colour to the left of red colour will lead to left-click and right-click if detected on other side. So, we will place blue markers on the index and ring fingers. Keyboard operations would be performed by moving the finger at a segment on the area, dedicated to that operation. Also, there will be other commonly used operations using other combinations. Thus, the user will be at relative ease in interacting with his computer. Especially in tasks like reading or browsing on the computer. Also, this project has huge scope in game controls.


<h3>Drawback:</h3>

The user would have to wear the colour markers on finger tips every time he wants to use the system.
